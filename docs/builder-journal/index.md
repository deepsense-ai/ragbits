# Builder Journal

This journal walks you through building a real GenAI application using Ragbits, step by step. Each section adds one capability layer on top of the previous one. You start with the simplest possible chat app and progressively turn it into a production-ready AI system.

## How This Journal Works

- **Every section ships something usable.** No setup-only sections. After each one, you have a working app you can run and test.

- **One concept per section.** Each step adds exactly one new capability, making it easy to learn incrementally or skip ahead.

- **Build on what you have.** Later sections extend earlier code. You won't rewrite anything as you grow, just add new layers.

- **Focus on your app, not infrastructure.** Ragbits handles the API server, UI, streaming, and state management so you can focus on business logic.
