# Installation

## Build from source

Dependencies needed to build and run Ragbits from the source code:

1. [**uv**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. [**python**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/install-python/) 3.10


## Linting and formatting
We use `ruff` for linting and formatting our code. To format your code, run:

```bash
$ uv run ruff format
```

To lint the code, run:
```bash
$ uv run ruff check --fix
```

## Type checking
We use `mypy` for type checking. To perform type checking, simply run:

```bash
$ uv run mypy .
```

## Testing
We use `pytest` for testing. To run the tests, simply run:

```bash
$ uv run pytest
```

Running integration tests requires PostgreSQL with the pgvector extention installed.
Minimal version of pgvector is 0.7.0, which added support for sparse vectors.

On Ubuntu Linux you can get in by installing the `postgresql-17-pgvector` package.

If it is not in your system's default repositories, you can install it from the official PostgreSQL Apt Repository:

```bash
sudo apt install postgresql-common
sudo /usr/share/postgresql-common/pgdg/apt.postgresql.org.sh
sudo apt install postgresql-17-pgvector
```

## Install pre-commit or pre-push hooks

We also recommend to run checkers on pre-commit/push hook. To set it up, follow these steps:

```bash
$ uv run scripts/install_git_hooks.py
```

Then decide whether you want to run the checks before each commit or before each push.
